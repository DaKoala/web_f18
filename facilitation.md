### 30% - Peer Facilitation
You will be leading the class in a discussion. Your presentation should last 5 minutes and relate to the week's topic.

Many professional web conferences will have slots to give quick talks. Familiarizing yourself with this style 
of talk will be useful in that context. This will also help when you are interviewing for a job as many companies
will ask that you prepare a quick tech-focused talk to share something you're interested in. It gives them a sense
of who you are, how you communicate, and how you teach technical topics.

This is an example of a great lightening talk:
